# OS-Folders

## How large is your collection? How broad is your collection?

I have a large collection with thousands of files. It is also quite broad, featuring hundreds of playlists, and dozens of genres / sub-genres / decades combinations.

My numbers are:
* 7000x individual tracks
* 300x individual playlists
* 50x sub-genres
* 10x major-genres
* 5x decades
* 2x separate DJs

To manage this complexity I've build my own set of personal tags that I fully trust.
As such, the first action on new files is to tag them into my structure. This ignores any previous tags made by someone else.

Below an example how my structure looks like; the full tree is far larger.
