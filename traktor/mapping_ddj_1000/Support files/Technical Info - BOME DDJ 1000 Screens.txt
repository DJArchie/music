Correct Initialization Sequence:
--------------------------------
 - Correct Initialization Sequence:
   - First DDJ device
   - then BOME
   - then Traktor
   - then CMDR (if needed)
 - Restarting
   - you can now close and reopen traktor at will.
   - do not close either BOME or CMDR (if it is running)
 - Any Problems? 
   - check "port closed" on BOME log window (click "outgoing")
   - press shift+quantize (=wake up) to force a "send monitor state"


   
   
Jog Needle State machine:
-------------------------
  inputs: 
    - play/pause
    - cue
    - jog touch
  
  state machine: 
    stopped -> [play] -> playing 
    playing -> [/play] -> paused 
    paused -> [play] -> playing 
        
    stopped -> [cue] -> cueing
    cueing -> [/cue] -> move to front -> stopped
    
    playing -> [cue] -> move to front -> stopped
    paused -> [cue] -> set new cue -> stopped

    playing -> [jog] -> jogging
    jogging -> [/jog] -> playing
    
              
   states: 
    stopped: 0
    playing: 1
    cueing: 2
 


MIDI routing:
-------------
   - All messages are routed by default (main project / settings / midi router)
   - processed messages use "swallow" to not be broadcasted
   - all processed messages are on the BMT1->DDJ direction
      - exception: jog turn is on the DDJ->BMT1 direction
   - all outputs on the traktor side need "blend"   
   - "mod 360" calculations: after mod, negative values need to be made positive by adding 360
     - oo = oo % 360
     - if oo < 0 then oo = oo + 360
  
   - Main path:    Traktor -> (BMT1) -> bome -> (DDJ-1000)
   - Reverse path: Traktor <- (BMT1) <- bome <- (DDJ-1000)


   I believe the unexpected problem here is that the “swallow” flag is only activated if both incoming trigger AND the Rules section pass. If “exit rules, skip Outgoing Action” is hit, then even if “swallow” is checked, it won’t swallow from this translator. You can, as you’ve done in your test preset, activate “swallow” from a different translator without rules and without outgoing action. 
  In other words, the swallow flag is only evaluated when the Outgoing Action is executed (even if it\'s the \"None\" action).

ADVANCED BOME INTEGRATION - 14-bit out messages:
------------------------------------------------
  Q2: The BPM and Percentage values are very close, but not exactly the same, of what it displayed on the laptop screen
  A2: Reason: Traktor lacks high-resolution MIDI out messages. Even so, a trick was already implemented to improve accuracy 10x times (compared to a naive mapping).

  T2: Traktor receives 14-bit messages just fine (combo messages), but cannot send it.
  This was confirmed by hacking CMDR to generate a valid TSI of a combo message - nothing got sent by Traktor.

  As a workaround, accuracy was improved 10x by creating 10x separate 7-bit ranges, each on a separate CC, and reacting to only a part of the whole range, eg: 0.0->0.1; 0.1->0.2; 0.2->0.3; ...
  This lead to the next problem: when the value crosses multiple ranges, potentially all, then all of them independently react with their extreme values. Note that these output values also follow a non-deterministic order.
  This was addressed as follows: collect all outputs until a 10ms timer expires, and ignore the extreme values, keeping only the final intermediate value (which can come in any order).
  If really going to an extreme value, in particular 0.0 or 1.0, collect that with 11th low resolution CC that encompasses the whole range.
  After the timer expires, process the single value as normal
  Q3: The time elapsed/remain is approximate to what is displayed on the laptop screen. Ans/Or, the seconds advances either too fast or too slow.
  A3: Reason: Traktor doesn't send the absolute minutes:seconds position, only the relative percentage position instead.
  The mapping guesses the total track length using an internal clock.
  press shift+quantize (="Wake up") while the track is playing to reset the measurement process.

  
ADVANCED BOME INTEGRATION - Absolute track position emulation:
-------------------------------------------------------------
  T3: even with the high-resolution trick explained above, it is still a relative position.
  To transform this into an absolute value, we implement a master clock in BOME with a timer every 100ms. On the seek position code we measure how many ticks elapsed when 0.5% of the track has elapsed without any jumps or interruptions.
  When we have this value, a simple multiplication by 200 gives the estimated track length, to which is then trivial to calculate elapsed/remain values in MM:SS format.
  As mentioned, pressing shift+quantize triggers a "send monitor state" command that resends all values, restarting the measurement process.

  
ADVANCED BOME INTEGRATION - Needle progress emulation:
------------------------------------------------------
  Q4: Needle position sometimes jumps around after scratching.
  A4: Traktor lacks a "jog turn out message", so this is emulated in BOME. Please join the DJTT discussion to improve this in the next version.

  T4: The best message to implement the needle position is "beat phase". Significant amount of time was spend using this message. It only sends the -45deg..45deg information. This is accumulated internally to a 0deg..360deg value that is displayed for the user.
  When the user seeks away, we just get a new 45deg position, unlinked to the actual 360 position. (this could be improved by merging with the 1000 points seek relative position descried above).
  Instead, we implemented the full state machine of the deck (stopped, playing, cueing), interpreted the jog touch and jog turn messages directly from the device (instead of traktor), and advanced the needle using the internal fake clock.

   cc 21 - send value of modifier 8 out
   
   page 2: modifier 8 = global modifier
   

  to send a value directly to a MODIFIER:
    bome: set variable to 0..7; send it as a value
    traktor: modifier IN / Fader / Relative / 100% sensitivity / 0% Acceleration
    
  to send a value directly to a deck layout:
    bome: set variable to 0..4; (send it + 0) * 127 / 4
    traktor: modifier IN / Fader / Direct
    (doing this to a modifier will print garbage, and use the last digits only)
    
  to send simple boolean ON/OFF:
    traktor: modifier IN / button / hold / 1

  "il"/3 - 0 - Parallel / 1 - Classic / 2 - Disabled mode (0/1)
  "im"/4 - PC APP CONNECT TIMER (disables forced side)
  
  
Generic Double click support:
---------------------
  "ie" - DlbClick: in progress  (0: None; 1: Inside timer; 2: Triggered)
  "if" - DlbClick: which channel
  "ig" - DlbClick: which note
  
  "ih" - previous track (with 2 seconds)  (?????)
   
  
Generic long press support:
-------------------
  "hi" - long press: current state  (0- nothing; 1-long press

  "hj" - long press: which channel
  "hl" - long press: which note
  "hm" - long press: triggered state  (0 =none; 1 = triggerd)

  
  
Turntable FX:
-------------  
  deck is paused: 
    pass B-1 normally
  
  deck is playing, flux OFF:
    received from DDJ:
      B-1: filter out if its playing
      B-1 invert: filter out always
    
    stepA: sends C#7:
      activates FX 
      dry wet 100%
      
    stepB: sends B-1:   (these actions can be swapped)
      pauses track
      beatjump
      dry wet 0%
      
    stepC: sends C#7 invert:
      turns off FX
  
    stepD: sends B-1 INVERT:
      dry wet 100%
       
  with flux ON:
    does C#7 action
    does C#7 INV action when the user releases the button

  timeline:
   - assumptions:
     - correct led is blinking if enabled
     - we always disable the led during analysis

  case1:     
   - b1 bliking
   - press b2
     - reset b1
        (ignored)
     - set b2
         - reset b2
   - timer:
      - set b2
      - return b2_single
      
  case1:     
   - b1 bliking
   - press b2
     - reset b1
        (ignored)
     - set b2

  rules state machine:
    send 00 - gets returned
    send 7f - NO RETURN
    
 
  VARIABLES:
    "jx" - state: 0: waiting, 1: in progress; 2: waiting final echo
    "jy" - which CFX button
    "jw" - press count  
    "jz" - free
    
    
  loopback feedback:
   - method: all commands are looped back if they change the state.
   - example:
    sent 00 7f
      recv 00 7f
    send 01 7f
      recv 00 00 
      recv 01 7f

Pad MLM and macroFX knob:
-------------------------  
  "is" macroFX Knob value (14 bit)
  "ix" pad MLM - previous pad pressed

  sequence is:
    change knob -> "is"
    press pad: remember pad ("ix") -> timer 30ms -> send knob -> send pad again

    
    
Fliter dual polarity:
---------------------    
  "l5"  filter polarity
