## Rekorbuddy aid

* This program runs Rekordbuddy in Windows (n a macOC VM). It depends on having a share with the same structure. 
* It aggregates all involved files in a work directory, converts between windows and macOS formats, and places the final rekordbox file in the appropriate final location
   
Please see help text in program for more details, usage and links to overviews   
   
## DJCU+RECU aid
