DDJ-1000/SZ/SX2 mapping Change Log:
-----------------------------------
- v6.3.3 - June 2019 - SpinBacks and Jog Ring
  - Fixes:
    - SpinBacks are now possible
    - Jog ring now displays the jog mode: Constant = volume up; blinking = jogFX enabled
    - added master info to screens
    - added final official installation instructions for INTERNAL/EXTERNAL controllers

- v6.3.2 - May 2019 - minor changes requested several times
  - Fixes:
    - Play/Pause is now immediate "on press", instead of "on release"

    - added list of limitations, plus the old official Pioneer installation instructions
  
- v6.3.1 - March 2019 - Minor DDJ-1000 bugfixes
  - Fixes:
	  - Cue monitor volume / Cue mix fixes
		- Parallel waveforms: removed automatic promotion to advanced size (this would require an improvement on TP3.1 itself) 
	- Known issues:
    - Provide option to either toggle Sync / Direct sync
		- Selecting different FX  should call save snapshot to ensure the same parameters are kept

  - New features:
	  - Full port of previous mapping to the DDJ-1000 midi codes

History Overview / Future plans:
--------------------------------
	DDJ-S* 2019 thread: http://forum.djtechtools.com/showthread.php?t=95073&page=5

	- I’m maintaining the most advanced mapping for ddj-*, made by JAJA 
		(v5.2.3, the map with the most functions and most downloads). 
		Because the midi codes are the same, 95% of mapping works in all ddj-s
		and ddj-r controllers.

	- On v6.0.0 of this mapping i’ve added macroFX plus a lot more fixes/changes. 
		The last 5% was made specific for the SZ in TP2. 

	- The v6.1.0 version adds the TP3 functions of mixerFX and slip reverse on top of everything else, 
		including a very easy way to access the most common functions (arrow left twice/arrow right). 
		It was also made tight for the SX2 as the video shows. 
		It works on TP2 except the TP3 specific functions. 

	- The next version for TP3 will be made tight for the SZ as well, plus more functions of course. 

	- A spin-off will be translating 1000s of entries for the ddj-1000/ddj-400 midi codes. 
		This will be a one way process, and I expect to need to maintain the two maps in parallel for years.﻿

DDJ-1000 CONFIGURATION MIDI mode:
---------------------------------
	to access configuation: press left shift + left play + turn on device
	slip reverse on  = forced midi mode
	slip reverse off = automatic change when rekordbox is running

	
DDJ-1000 Back-2-back USAGE (2x USB):
------------------------------------
 - setting USB_A/LINE/USB_B selector controls who receives MIDI commands (in/out) only for selected deck
   - ie: jogwheels, play/pause, pads, browser.
	 
 - this parameter affects ALL mixer controls
   - gain, volume, EQ, cross fader
	 - all beatFX (including dry/wet)
	 - colorFX buttons
	 - Filter knob
	 
	 - exception: headphone CUE button
   
   
DDJ-1000 with external soundcards:
----------------------------------
  As explained on the "caveats section", the pioneer effects are only applied to the master channel OR for external inputs. 
  Internal inputs will have traktor effects, unless you select "MST" (that affects all decks).

  A workaround is using an external sound card like an audio6, as follows:
  - Traktor MIDI control: channel 1+2
  - Audio6 external sound card: channel 3+4

  this is the same setup as this Serato + DDJ-1000 video:

DDJ-SZ encoder mode:

	jog:      41/3f
	Browser:	01/7E
	FX beat:  01/7E
		

ddj-400 support:
----------------
  I've now tried my mapping on a DDJ-400 on a shop. 
  Most of the features do work - but it is definitively not ideal. 
  If I had a DDJ-400 myself I could easily make a specific version for it.


  Large parts of the DDJ-1000 map are compatible with the DDJ-400. 
  Caveats:
  - the DDJ-1000 cue mix / cue volume is done in hardware, so I don't duplicate this in traktor;  
    - the 400 requires adding these 2x commands (which are trivial to map)
  - RGB colors are not supported, so pad user feedback is gone. 
    - in the 1000 you get beautiful RBG colors for each function
  - "shift2" button does not exist, so my overlayed functions do not work (Beatjump, vinyl stop)
    - this can easily be mapped to the memory call buttons
  - the pad modes have a differnt order than the 1000 (Hot cue / beatlop / beatjump / sampler)
    - the functions are still accessible, but not on the documented positions
	
  
DDJ-SR/RR support:
------------------
	The whole SX2 map is compatible with the SR and RR controllers. 
  
  Only differences are:
  - higher resolution jogwheels require higher sensitivity in all jog commands
    - jog turn
    - jogFX knob
  - shift2 button is missing. This is now mapped to loop capture button  
  - pad modes sequence: minor or no differences at all
   
   
  on CMDR, select interaction: "encoder relative"
  - scratch (dug)
    - SX2:
      - sensitivity:  10
      - acceleration: 19
    - SR:
      - sensitivity:  25
      - acceleration: 19
    - 1000:
      - sensitivity:  5
      - acceleration: 14

  - JFX2 knobs:
    - SX2:
      - knob1:  25/0
      - knob2+3: 20/0
    - SR:
      - (NOT FIXED - SAME AS SX2)
    - 1000:
      - knob1:   12/0
      - knob2+3:  8/0
      

	
deck shift codes:
-----------------
  deck 1: ch1 F#8 / g#8
  deck 2: ch2 F#8 / g#8
  deck 3: ch3 F#8 / g#8
  deck 4: ch4 F#8 / g#8
	
	DDJ-1000: only ch3 F#8, 0 and invert
		
	
	search left  A#6
	search right B6
	
	memory: c#4 / d4
	
	quantize (hot cue long): a#7
	quantize 1000: F3 / A3

	
	auto loop: G#0 / G#5
	
	loop in:   E0 / E5
	loop out:  F0 / F5
	
	loop 1/2:  F#0 / c#7
	loop 2x:   G0  / D7
	
	
	play/pause: b-1 / b4
	cue:        c0  / c5
	
	
	
CMDR TP3 missing commands:
--------------------------
  to create page:
		slip reverse = ok
		reverse = change to toggle
	
	to create mapping:
		import TSI
		delete page
		add page
		export TSI


    
DDJ-1000 screens support:
-------------------------
Method 1: 
 - VirtualDJ managed to hack the proprietary Pioneer protocol to display full information. 
 - Documentation: nothing is public
 - Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8yeW9ONtGI

Method 2: 
 - DjayPro uses simple MIDI commands to display only basic information. 
 - I've tried to use these midi out, but the traktor controller manager was not expressive enough to generate these exact midi out values 
 - MIDI-out is documented by pioneer on page 8 of their MIDI list. Screenshot: https://github.com/pestrela/music_scripts/blob/master/other/ddj-1000%20screens%20midi%20out.PNG
 - Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCUpDQD7i_M
 - Demo2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAUo4KMD70k   (Djay + Rekordbox)
