# MindMap Summary

This page has my knowledge sharing about Traktor, Mappings, Hardware, DJing, DJ Set, etc.\
The picture below summarizes the main ideas and dependencies explained in these blog posts.
![traktor_mindmap](pics/traktor_mindmap.png?raw=true)

# OS-Folders

## How large is your collection? How broad is your collection?

I have a large collection with thousands of files. It is also quite broad, featuring hundreds of playlists, and dozens of genres / sub-genres / decades combinations.

My numbers are:
* 7000x individual tracks
* 300x individual playlists
* 50x sub-genres
* 10x major-genres
* 5x decades
* 2x separate DJs

To manage this complexity I've build my own set of personal tags that I fully trust.
As such, the first action on new files is to tag them into my structure. This ignores any previous tags made by someone else.

Below an example how my structure looks like; the full tree is far larger.
![DJ Genres](pics/folder_organization_dj_genres.png?raw=true)

See also [Why I manage music using OS-folders only](#why-i-manage-music-using-os-folders-only).
  

## Why I manage music using OS-folders only

Above, I've explained [the size and complexity of my collection](#How-large-is-your-collection-How-broad-is-your-collection).\
This is nothing new; I know many DJs with [the same "problem"](https://code.google.com/archive/p/serato-itch-sync/). The difference is on the *how*; In my case I manage the collection only in OS-folders, instead of DJ-playlists.

Main reasons are:
* **#1: Multiple Windows:** File explorer opens instantaneously with Win+E, and allows any number of windows, monitors and [tabs](http://qttabbar.wikidot.com/). 
* **#2: Tree Tagging:** More crucially, all windows have the whole tree visible. This is essential to quickly tag my files by just moving them to the correct correct folder. Similarly, the structure grows just by creating new sub-folders as needed.
* **#3: Simpler Folders**: OS-Folders contain either files, sub-folders, or both. [This 2-step organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(computing)#History) is simpler is than the iTunes 3-step model of "folders -> playlists -> files" (later copied by almost all DJ softwares).
* **#4: Local Searches:** By far my most common task is to check if I already have a particular track, and where is it tagged. File explorer allows local searches on a folder and its sub-folders only. This enables me to quickly find things by just typing a few letters of the filename. AFAIK only Serato has this feature (called ["include subcrates"](https://support.serato.com/hc/en-us/articles/227626268-Subcrates))
* **#5: Tags Cleanup:** Before tagging the file, I rename the filenames to correct its artist / title. [MP3tag](https://www.mp3tag.de/en/) helps a lot to clean up the formatting, using [my own scripts](collections_without_playlists/Mp3tagSettings.zip) to automatically capitalize the names as “ARTIST1 ft. ARTIST2 - Capitalized Title - Remix”, and to update the internal mp3 tags. 
* **#6: Software Independence:** Using OS-folders you are independent of any possible DJ software and itunes. It also trivial to [sync between laptops](#how-i-synchronize-and-backup-my-whole-traktor-music-and-configuration-across-laptops-and-a-nas) and make perfect backups [to my NAS](https://www.synology.com/en-global/products/DS718+). It is also trivial to load a whole genres to USB sticks to listen in cars.

## How to manage your collection using operating systems folders and without DJ playlists (ie, using only Finder, Windows Explorer, etc) 

Above I've described [Why I manage music using OS-folders only](#why-i-manage-music-using-os-folders-only). In this post I will describe *how* I manged to **fully automate** my workflow between DJ softwares.

* **#0: File operations:** [As explained above](#why-i-manage-music-using-os-folders-only) I continuously search files, change the filenames and move the files around left and right.
* **#1: Traktor Repair:** When I first open Traktor, it automatically [repairs its own database](#why-is-traktor-my-software-of-choice-a-database-repair-mass-relocate). For this I just run a mass-relocate on my whole music root folder, which refinds all moved and renames files in a single go.
* **#2: Update collection:** The second step is just to import the whole music root folder into Traktor. As this skips previous files, in practice it only imports the New files. The last step is to delete the remaining missing files (that are really deleted - otherwise they would been found on step #1) 
* **#3: Duplicate Cues**: For the rare cases that a file is in multiple sub-genres, I just copy them physically in different folders.  Then I run a [python script](collections_without_playlists/traktor_clone_cues.py) to automatically duplicate the CUEs for these files. This tool is similar to [the traktor Librarian](http://www.flowrl.com/librarian).
* **#4: Dj Converter:** I use the [DJ Data Converter](#which-dj-converters-avoid-the-26ms-shift-issue) to generate the rekordbox.xml file without the [26ms shift problem](#what-is-the-26ms-shift-issue-when-converting-cuesloops-between-softwares).
* **#5: Rekordbox Import:** On rekordox first I delete all missing files, then import the whole collection "as-is", and then update the collection with the XML file that came from the (repaired) Traktor collection. These steps are fully automatic and it ensures the Rekordbox collection matches the Traktor collection.
* **#6: Rekordbox Search:** I only use rekordbox for video gigs. There I use the explorer node to see my files, and search for files in the whole collection. For the rare case I need to search inside a "playlist", I use a real File Explorer window in parallel when needed (because rekordbox [still lacks a search box in OS-folders](#why-is-traktor-my-software-of-choice-b-os-search-no-playlists))
* **#7: CDJ export:** I only really need playlists for CDJs. There are scripts to mass-convert all folders to DJ playlists. Then I do the usual rekordbox step to prepare USBs pens.
  * Windows version is http://samsoft.org.uk/iTunes/ImportFolderStructure.vbs; 
  * Mac version is https://dougscripts.com/itunes/scripts/ss.php?sp=droptoaddnmake; 
  * A Serato-specific version is in https://code.google.com/archive/p/serato-itch-sync/

# Traktor software


## Why is Traktor my software of choice

Traktor has unique features - big and small - that I depend on.\
Other softwares have nice unique features too, but miss these ones that I depend on.

https://github.com/pestrela/music_scripts/tree/master/traktor#why-is-traktor-my-software-of-choice

See also [which features I miss in Traktor](#Which-features-I-miss-in-Traktor).

## Why is Traktor my software of choice: a) Database repair (mass relocate)

Traktor is above to find RENAMED files fully automatically without losing CUE points, beat grid or re-analysis.

I RENAME and MOVE files very regularly at the OS-folders level, using Windows Explorer/macOS finder.

When Traktor starts, it does a "consistency check" to confirm if all files are still there. (demo: [0:24 of this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_zYavcCa7k&t=24s)). This finds all missing files in a single go (demo: [0:50 of this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_zYavcCa7k&t=50))\
Then, the mass-relocate process fixes everything in a single go as well; you just select the root folder that contains your files "somewhere". In the extreme worst case this would be your whole hard drive. (demo: [5:36 of this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_zYavcCa7k&t=320s)).

The relocate process is reasonably straightforward for MOVED files. However it is much much harder for RENAMED files.\
Traktor is the only software that achives that because it fingerprints everything in a private field called "[AudioId](https://www.mail-archive.com/mixxx-devel@lists.sourceforge.net/msg05061.html)")

When the mass-relocate process ends, everything is magically found again. Crucially all metadata is kept: CUE points, beat grid, analysed BPM, stripe, etc.\
Together with the OS-search feature described below, this enables me to use folders as "virtual playlists".
* Comparison to Rekordbox: Renamed files need to be relocated FILE by FILE.\
Moved files can be done FOLDER by FOLDER.\
If this manual process is skipped, the files are seen as brand new, losing all meta-data.\
[An external tool](https://github.com/edkennard/rekordbox-repair) helps the moved files case. [Example of Pioneer forum request](https://forums.pioneerdj.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/115018095303-Reasons-to-think-i-leave-from-rekordbox-?page=1#community_comment_360000392646)
* Comparison to VDJ: Everything need to be relocated FILE by FILE.
* Comparison to Serato: To test.


## Why is Traktor my software of choice: b) OS-search (no playlists)

Traktor allows searching inside any OS folders. I don't have DJ playlists inside Traktor; instead, my OS-folders are my "virtual playlists".\
I have a very large collection with dozens of genres, sub-genres and decades. For that I've created a structure where each decade is a separate folder, inside a parent genre/sub-genre folders.\
When I'm playing a specific genre I can search only that decade (=OS folder). If I want something else I can always search the whole collection at any time.\
([See this blog post for more detail on these methods](#how-to-manage-your-collection-using-operating-systems-folders-and-without-dj-playlists-ie-using-only-finder-windows-explorer-etc))
* Comparison to Rekordbox: Rekordbox displays OS folders, but you can't search inside them. [Example of Pioneer forum request](https://forums.pioneerdj.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/115018095303-Reasons-to-think-i-leave-from-rekordbox-?page=1#community_comment_360000392646)
* Comparison to Serato: Serato has a nicer way to display OS folders, but you can't search inside them
* Comparison to VDJ: VDJ has really good OS-searches, better than traktor, by having a "recurse" option to see all sub-folder files in a flat view



## Why is Traktor my software of choice: c) Advanced MIDI mapping
  
Traktor supports complex MIDI mapping with 8x variables, 2x conditionals and any number of actions per MIDI input

My [DDJ-1000 mapping has FX chains of the Jogwheel](https://github.com/pestrela/music_scripts/blob/master/traktor/ddj_1000_traktor_mapping/DDJ-1000%20v6.5.1%20TP3%20-%20Quick%20overview.pdf). For a demo, see at 6:30 of this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9tQZEHr8hk&t=392s \
My [AKAI AMX mapping has 10 layers built using shifts and states](https://github.com/pestrela/music_scripts/blob/master/traktor/akai_amx_traktor_mapping/AMX%20v1.0.1%20TP3_TP2%20-%20Quick%20overview.pdf) to cram A LOT more functionality than the existing buttons.\
This is only possible if midi mapping has variables and multiple actions per physical input.
\
* Comparison to Rekordbox: No variables at all, no multiple actions. They only allow you to assign a single command to a single button. 
* Comparison to Serato: No variables at all, no multiple actions. They only allow you to assign a single command to a single button. 
* Comparison to VDJ: VDJ is even better than traktor, has it has a full scripting language built-in ([VDJscript](https://www.virtualdj.com/wiki/VDJscript.html)). 
It features infinite variables, conditions and states; Traktor only has 8 variables, 2 conditions and 8 states.\
  VDJ also features extremely nice [mapping editor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SU2OyDB9PQ&t=200),
  [pad editor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eT1nZVpUUr8&t=50),
  and [custom button editor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGbw2RHV_j0&t=180), all with dropdowns and chained together.

See also ["Why I moved to BOME midi mapping"](#BOME-mappings-migration).


## Why is Traktor my software of choice: d) Hotcues move the temporary cue as well

I use the hotcues as internal "bookmarks". In Traktor, pressing a hotcue moves the temporary cue as well.\
This is very useful for  previewing an old song that you dont remember anymore. When you are done, you just move it to the last point using the big round button.
* Comparison to Rekordbox: No option to move the temporary cue when pressing a hotcue. This causes massive confusion to me every single time. This would be trivial to fix using advanced MIDI mapping. [This was requested in their forum](https://forums.pioneerdj.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360021313752-Is-there-any-way-at-all-to-reassign-the-cue-button-to-cue-to-the-most-recently-selected-hot-cue-rather-than-only-being-used-to-make-cue-points-)
* Comparison to Serato: untested
* Comparison to VDJ: untested, but not a problem for sure (trivial to change using advanced MIDI mapping)

## Why is Traktor my software of choice: e) Stronger Sync than others

Traktor features a very strong master clock that was built for the remix decks. As such its sync is in general stronger than the other softwares I tested. 
Using Beatsync the phrasing is always kept for any action I might do to the track: Beatjump, Hot cues, Temporary Cue, Pitch bend, Tempo change, Scratch, etc.

* Comparison to Serato: see [this comparison video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyAj4IyFNCs). Even there I still found myself having the "gold" sync instead of the desired "blue" sync
* Comparison to Rekordbox: It has the best sync outside Traktor 
* Comparison to VDJ: untested

    
## Which features I miss in Traktor

Specific features:
* **#1: Include subcrates** just like [serato](https://support.serato.com/hc/en-us/articles/227626268-Subcrates)
* **#2: Elastic beatgrids**: This is crucial as I play very old music and many music styles. [tool](#how-to-emulate-elastic-beatgrids-in-traktor)
* **#3: Pioneer DDJ**: Plug-and-Play to Pioneer gear / DDJ controllers, because this is the [most popular equipment today](../census_graphs)
* **#4: Pad modes**: I have multiple pad modes in my mappings, but would love to see them on screen, and have an associated pad editor just like Rekordbox and VirtualDJ
* **#5: Turntable FX**: Turntable start&stop on the [play/pause button](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPnmyDiaJTE)
* **#6: Video support**
* **#7: [VDJscript](https://www.virtualdj.com/wiki/VDJscript.html)**, with a lot more than 8x variables and 2x conditions
* **#8: Smart playlists** and related tracks

In general I fully agree with [this Digital DJ Tips article](https://www.digitaldjtips.com/2019/10/what-next-for-traktor/). Generic comments:
* #1: “Please embrace hardware partners again…”
* #2: “Please speed up software development!”
* #3: “Please, no more reinventing the wheel :)”

But in the end Traktor has [has unique features that I depend on](#why-is-traktor-my-software-of-choice).

## How to emulate Elastic Beatgrids in Traktor

Traktor misses elastic beatgrids. This is crucial for live drummers and old electronic music.

It is impossible to do perfect **beatjumps** because you cannot compensate with jogs.\
Same story for perfect **BPM-based Effects** like delay.

This was also the #1 request from the [Digital DJ Tips interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFcnImYgsII&feature=youtu.be&t=199)


Below a recipe to **approximate** Elastic beatgrids in Traktor, automatically using Rekordbox conversion.
The simplest method is presented first, then a more acurate/faster method is presented second.

Simple method:  
1. Download the free V5 rekordbox: [link](https://rekordbox.com/en/download5/)
1. Select the tracks with single, but unsteady, BPMs: [guide](https://rekord.cloud/blog/should-you-analyze-your-tracks-with-dynamic-bpm-in-rekordbox) 
1. Analyse these tracks in dynamic mode: [guide](https://rekord.cloud/blog/should-you-analyze-your-tracks-with-dynamic-bpm-in-rekordbox)
1. Export your collection.xml: [guide](https://rekord.cloud/wiki/library-import)
1. Convert your this file from Rekordbox format to Traktor format: [guide](#which-dj-converters-avoid-the-26ms-shift-issue)
1. Import your files into Traktor: [guide](https://rekord.cloud/wiki/library-export)

## How to emulate Elastic Beatgrids in Traktor - More complex workflow

This is a revised version of the [basic workflow(#How-to-emulate-Elastic-Beatgrids-in-Traktor). 

Benefits are more accuracy of the end result because it adds additional beatmarkers every 4 beats, 
it avoids the [26ms mp3 shift issue](#what-is-the-26ms-shift-issue-when-converting-cuesloops-between-softwares)
and its a lot faster by limiting the tracks and by directly patching the cues in the collection (instead of regular importing the files).


Differences are:
* Download specifically v5.6.0 rekordbox. 
  * This was the last without an XML import bug: [guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JV89dj1hDWM)
* Manually remove the non-dynamic tracks from the XML.
  * There is no way to export specific playlists/tracks, you always get the whole collection
  * so by manually removing the tracks the later stages will be a lot faster  
* Use [rekordbox_add_beatmarkers.py](tools_traktor/rekordbox_add_beatmarkers.py) 
  * This will force a beatmarker every 4 beats. 
  * These beatmarkers are very accurate because it still uses the dynamic BPM **before** conversion. 
* Use a converter that specifically addresses the 26-ms shift issue: [guide](#which-dj-converters-avoid-the-26ms-shift-issue)
* Patch your files into Traktor using [Traktor_clone_cues.py](#what-software-tools-did-you-built-for-Traktor)

[Traktor forum post](https://www.native-instruments.com/forum/threads/how-to-emulate-elastic-beatgrids-in-traktor-via-rekordbox-conversion.375229/)

## Which tracks benefit from emulated Elastic beatgrids?

**Unsteady tracks: YES**
* Examples: 80s Pop, 70s DiscoSound, Live drummers (any decade)
* Typical range: +- 1% bpm error
* Error: Very small; the error is reset every 4th beat will always reset it

**Transition tracks: NO**
* Examples:
  * [Magic Drum Orchestra - Drop it like its Hot](https://youtu.be/W-nrHptw4Ow) 85->115 bpm, Abrupt change
  * [Planet Soul - Set me Free](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5HEfbxk7Mw) 126->98 bpm, Smooth change
* Typical range: +- 15% bpm  (change from 3/4 to 4/4 signature)
* Error: Too much; the 3rd beat will have an half beat error (see picture)
  * Note: setting beatmarkers every 1 beat breaks Traktor sync dynamics

[list2](https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/ybt30/transition_tracks/)

Note: manually beatgriding tracks in rekordbox is tricky because its a strictly left-to-right operaton.\
In other words: there is no way to put beatmarkers in front of the track without deleting them at the middle/end as well.\

# BOME mappings migration

Traktor has advanced MIDI mapping ([link](https://bit.ly/2NrlVzy)), which is important to extend its longevitity.

However every year Controllers get more complex, so doing mappings today ranges between hard to impossible ([link](https://bit.ly/2NrlVzy)).

Some other anedotic evidence on this are the [preferences freeze](https://www.native-instruments.com/forum/threads/preferences-window-freeze.328315/page-2#post-1870879), the turntable play/pause looper, the DDJ-1000SRT missing jog screens, 
and the HC-4500 mapping to get track details.

Specific Blog posts:
* [a) Impossible mapping features](#Why-I-moved-to-BOME-midi-mapping-Impossible-features)
* [b) Possible, but with major limits](#Why-I-moved-to-BOME-midi-mapping-Traktor-limits)
* [c) BOME limits](#Some-Limitations-of-BOME-mappings)
* [d) Future of Traktor mappings](#How-I-see-the-future-of-Traktor-mappings)

Because of this all my latest mappings require [BOME](https://www.bome.com/products/miditranslator).\
(The older versions do not require BOME and are simpler to install).


![bome_versions](pics/bome_versions.jpg?raw=true)

  
## Why I moved to BOME midi mapping: Impossible features

* **#1: 14-bit out messages**: Trakor supports *receiving* high resolution midi messages. I need to *send* them as well [on my DDJ-1000 mapping](../ddj/1%20MIDI%20codes/DDJ-1000RB%20-%20MIDI%20Messages.pdf)
* **#2: Sequence of Events**: For PadFX, I *first* need to change the FX, and *then* need to turn it on. This is not something Traktor support; both actions are tried simultaneously resulting in something else. More info: page 88 of the [Rudi Elephant mapping](pics/RUDI-Js%20ELEPHANT%20TSI%20for%20VCI-400SE%20%2B%20Maschine%20(MK1)%20%2B%20BCR%202000%20v2.0.pdf).
* **#3: Timers**: Something simple as end-of-track blinking require timers to schedule actions for later. Same story for [vinyl break on the play/pause button](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPnmyDiaJTE), as implemented by [Traktor Mapping Service](http://traktormappingservice.com/)
* **#4: Any event as a Conditional**: Some events can be inputs to conditionals, like "is in active loop". However many events are missing, for example "which deck is master." To implement this, please see page 87 of the [Rudi Elephant mapping](pics/RUDI-Js%20ELEPHANT%20TSI%20for%20VCI-400SE%20%2B%20Maschine%20(MK1)%20%2B%20BCR%202000%20v2.0.pdf).


## Why I moved to BOME midi mapping: Traktor Limits

Also, I've also hit the limits of Traktor mappings multiple times. Below are the features that are possible in Traktor but only by significantly increasing the mapping complexity.

* **a) more modifiers**: I use a lot more than [8 modifiers](https://www.native-instruments.com/forum/threads/controllerism-more-modifiers-more-bits-more-conditions.329045/). I use a lot more than 3 bits per modifier state. To go around this I add a lot of complexity to my mappings. This in turn [freezes your preferences](https://www.native-instruments.com/forum/threads/preferences-window-freeze.328315/page-2#post-1870879) window - please see below.
* **b) preferences window freeze:** To add more variables, you need to add extra mapping pages. Having more than 6 pages [freeze your preferences window](https://www.native-instruments.com/forum/threads/preferences-window-freeze.328315/page-2#post-1870879) **even if they are completely empty**.
* **c) more conditionals**: I use a lot more than [2 conditions in my mappings](https://www.native-instruments.com/forum/threads/add-3rd-slot-for-modifier-conditions-in-controller-manager.325569/#post-1622169). To go around this I [squeezed multipe states into each modifier](https://www.traktorbible.com/en/squeezing-modifiers.aspx). Again, this added a lot of complexity to my mappings.
* **d) global modifiers:** I miss [global modifiers](https://www.native-instruments.com/forum/threads/named-variables-operators.326339/#post-1628411), to link the state in multiple pages. More info: page 87 of the [Rudi Elephant mapping](pics/RUDI-Js%20ELEPHANT%20TSI%20for%20VCI-400SE%20%2B%20Maschine%20(MK1)%20%2B%20BCR%202000%20v2.0.pdf).


## Some Limitations of BOME mappings

[BOME](https://www.bome.com/products/miditranslator) is essential to [build my new mappings](#Why-I-moved-to-BOME-midi-mapping-Impossible-features). But it also have some improvement points.

In importance order:

* **A) Arrays**: [forum request](https://www.bome.com/support/kb/mt-pro-script-arrays). See also Bug#3 from the FAQ file.
* **B) Cascaded devices**: [forum request](https://www.bome.com/support/kb/cascaded-presets-loopback-devices)
* **C) More variables**: this is a lot more than Traktor, but still not enough as I'm emulating arrays


## How I see the future of Traktor mappings

A major Traktor strength is the MIDI mappings system. Very flexible and powerful.\
Traktor maps are by far the most popular in https://maps.djtechtools.com \
Large mappings are really complex to build - but once this is done other users immediately benefit by just installing them.

However the Traktor mappings system didn't get improvements for years, and [is is now quite old](#Why-I-moved-to-BOME-midi-mapping-Traktor-limits).\
It now is also impossible to use it alone [to map the latest controllers](#Why-I-moved-to-BOME-midi-mapping-Impossible-features).

For example in my DDJ-1000 mapping I had to use BOME midi translator as a middle man:\
https://maps.djtechtools.com/mappings/9279

In my view the mappings are a unique sucess story of Traktor. This could continue to give great results with just some quality-of-life improvements.



# Hardware Controllers

## Why is DDJ-1000 my hardware of choice

Previously I explained [I why use Traktor](#why-is-traktor-my-software-of-choice). So why do I use it with a controller made for Rekordbox, instead of the S4Mk3??

Before we discuss this, please note that some years ago DJs could use any Software with any Hardware combination. 
This was a fully supported (and encouraged!) model by the vendors, which used this model to make real money from real customers. 

Having said this, the DDJ-1000 has major features that I personally value significantly over the S4Mk3:

* **A) BIG jogs wheels:** This is so important that [it gets a dedicated blog post ](#why-i-like-big-jogwheels)
  
* **B) More pad modes.** All my most useful functions are a maximum of 2 clicks away - and without using any shifts. 
  Main Pad modes are a) Hotcue, b) Roll/padFX, c) MacroFX, d) JogFX. 
  Pressing twice the same pad mode cycles the top 2 sub-pages of that pad mode. This is way the Reloop Elite mixer works. 
  I’ve got even more stuff on the secondary pad modes, accessible with a shift+mode. 

* **C) Two USB ports.** This is crucial for seamless hand-overs between DJs; and for safety of connecting a backup laptop ready at any time.
  
* **D) JogFX combos on the jogs.** Please see them in my demo videos (eg 6:32 of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9tQZEHr8hk&t=392s ). 
  This is turnkey in my mapping, i’m not familiar if they have it on the S4mk3 (it was present for sure on the S4MK1 DJTT mappings)

* **E) BeatFx**. This is in the correct place of the mixer (lower right corner = right hand of the DJ), with a FX selector knob to select the effect by name

* **F) Connectivity**. Thr DDJ-1000 has more inputs and outputs, microphones etc. In particular, the mixer has a full FX suite for any external inputs (colorFX + beatFX)

Note: the S4mk3 is a fantastic controller - I have recommended it to several people before. In particular the loop/beatjump encoders implementation is the gold standard for that.\
The overall integration is better, of course, which is a plus if you prefer plug-and-play vs customization. 

But in the end its really the big jogwheels that is the crucial deal breaker; This was completely abandoned by NI in 2014 with the release of the S8, and was only picked-up in 2018 with the S4MK3 (although, in my opinion, still not the same as the DDJ-1000).


## DDJ-1000 comparison to DDJ-SZ and AKAI AMX

Besides [my DDJ-1000](#why-is-ddj-1000-my-hardware-of-choice), I have several other controllers fully [mapped to Traktor](#What-are-your-main-Traktor-mappings). 

Main differences are:\

DDJ-1000:
* **Jogs:** CDJ big Jogwheels 
* **Screens:** Jog screens
* **Size**: More portable than SZ, but more cramped as well
* **BeatFX:** BeatFX in the lower right corner to the mixer

DDJ-SZ:
* **Size:** Very spacious. A joy to use!
* **Jogs:** Extra-smooth big Jogwheels
* **Filter:** Pioneer soundcolor FXs in hardware, including the Pioneer filter with a lot of Resonance

AKAI AMX:
* **Ultra portable:** The AMX replaces 4x devices: Z1 Mixer + X1 controller + Twister Fighter + Audio2. 
Its so small I carry it everywhere I go. 
* **DVS:** The AMX is the cheapest and smallest way to unlock DVS 
* **Mapping:** My mapping unlocks all TP3 functions

See also [this DDJ-SZ comparison](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beatmatch/comments/c6vquf/help_me_ddj_sz_vs_ddj_1000/)



## Why I like BIG jogwheels

Spoiler: its not scratching!

I use jogs all the time in a controller - full list below. 
As I have big hands, I love them to be as BIG as possible.

There are the usages sorted by frequency:
* **#1: Tempo**: Adjusting tempo drift for older tracks (because of no elastic beatgrid)
* **#2: Cueing**: / fast preview to the exact spot where the track will start
* **#3: JogFX chains**: I do effects on the jog - see 6:32 of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9tQZEHr8hk&t=392s
* **#4: Beagrids**: by far the quickest way to adjust beatgrids on the fly
* **#5: Scratch**: Very occasional live scratching / tricks  (see also [this post](#but-can-i-still-scratch-using-midi-how-much-is-the-latency-of-your-maps))

What I dont use on jogs:
* **Moving jogs**: these are cool, but not a deal-breaker for me
* **Haptic feedback**: this is basically a gimmick for me

## But can I still scratch using MIDI? How much is the latency of your maps?

**TL;DR:** YES you can scratch - as long you have a fast computer. Please see at 4:10 of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9tQZEHr8hk&t=249) for a demo.\
Even better, try it [completely for free](#can-i-test-your-mappings-for-free), and see for youself.

**Long answer:**

Of course that If you are a 100% scratch DJ, then you should look for a native HID solution.\
But for the extreme vast majority of DJs I know, this solution is more than enough.

Some relevant points:
* Scratching is [only the 5th criteria for my jogwheels](#why-i-like-big-jogwheels)
* The [latest DDJ-1000 mapping](#What-are-the-features-of-your-DDJ-1000-Traktor-mapping) helps a lot. You can now can see the jog needle and your hand simultaneously.
* Pioneer has sold products with this solution for many years ([example](https://www.pioneerdj.com/en/support/software-information/archive/ddj-sz/#traktor))

## What are the features of your Keyboard mappings?

### A) Beatgrid helper

**Links:**
*	Download Link: https://maps.djtechtools.com/mappings/9760

**Summary:**
*	Use this mapping to beatgrid your music in Traktor faster
*	Features: quick seek,  quick zoom, next song, shortcut, lock, auto, etc
*	All keys have a “faster” version using the shift

![](pics/beatgrid_helper_-_slide.jpg?raw=true)


### B) Transitions-Aligned Beatjumps

**Links:**
*	https://maps.djtechtools.com/mappings/9762

**Summary:**
*	Use this mapping to prepare transitions-aligned beatjumps. This mapping lets you beatjump on both deck A and B simultaneously, so that you can put CUEs to align them
*	Row “one” of your keyboard beatjumps deck A; row “two” beatjumps deck B; row “three” beatjumps both decks simultaneously. Row “zero” controls the crossfader as well. 
*	EXAMPLE: please the transition around 52m of this mix.Song “A” is singing when “B” starts entering at 52m07s. For 30s, song “A” is singing normally. When “A” stops singing at 52m41s, “B” starts singing exactly at that time. This mapping helps a lot these fun transitions.

## Can I test your mappings for FREE?

Yes. All my mappings work fine with the demo versions of both Traktor and BOME. So if you have these controllers you can just try them in no time. 

If you are considering buying equipment then I recommend that you test the mapping yourself in a shop showroom. I do this all the time before I buy anything (just mention this to the shop personnel).

Finally, all my mappings are a free gift to the community, to enable DJs to use their preferred Software with their preferred Hardware.
If you want further appreciation, PayPal donations are welcome (pedro.estrela@gmail.com)
  

## Is the DDJ-1000SRT also mappable to Traktor?

**Yes.** I've updated [my SZ/SX2 mapping](#what-are-the-features-of-your-ddj-sx2--ddj-sz--ddj-srt-traktor-mapping)
to work on the SRT. 
Please see the demo video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aU3QnOez56A&t=2s

Specific comments:
* **Jogs screens:** Jog Screens are NOT supported in MIDI. This is a business decision of the Serato company. 
  * If this affects you, please voice your opinion on this feature request thread: 
  * https://serato.com/forum/discussion/1736390
* **Pioneer Effects**: Mixer runs in external mode. This means that you have all pioneer effects for Traktor music. 
  * This is very different from the regular DDJ-1000, which runs in internal mode and only has Pionner beatFX in the master channel for Traktor sources.
* **Scratching:** Please put your jog weight to “heavy”.  This will significantly improve scratching and jogFX. Also please avoid VINYL OFF mode. The TSI disables jog touch in this case, but the jog loses resolution compared to VINYL ON mode;

## Is the DDJ-XP2 mappable to Traktor?

The XP2 is now really popular because its the cheapest way 
to unlock [Rekordbox V6 performance](#What-is-NOT-unlocked-in-the-Rekordbox-V6-hardware-options).
 
My [DDJ-1000 mapping](https://maps.djtechtools.com/mappings/9279) is compatible with the XP1/XP2.\
So it will work. But it was not made specific to it, so some features might be missing.

Strong recommendation is to use v6.3.3 of my DDJ-1000 mapping.\
This is because later versions require [BOME](https://www.bome.com/products/miditranslator), 
are more complex [to install](mapping_ddj_1000/Installation%20Help/DDJ%20Mappings%20-%20Installation%20Guide.pdf), 
and focus on non-XP2-relevant features like the jog screens.
  
## Does (random DDJ controller) works with your mapping? Are the jogs good?

Pioneer has **dozens** of controllers. I own 3x of them, so ONLY there the mappings are 100% tight:
* DDJ-1000
* DDJ-SZ
* DDJ-SX2

The other controllers [are compatible](../ddj/1%20MIDI%20codes) - but there are always differences.\
**So for these [please try the mapping FOR FREE](#can-i-test-your-mappings-for-free) in a shop/friend.**

Once in a while I test controllers in a shop myself; ONLY in this case I describe the results in the first page of the mapping manual.\
The DDJ-1000SRT is a special case, [which I cover in detail here](#is-the-ddj-1000srt-also-mappable-to-traktor)


Regarding the Jogs: this is exactly the same story, plus the [all the comments about MIDI jogs](#But-can-i-still-scratch-using-MIDI-How-much-is-the-latency-of-your-maps)

## Read this if your Play button doesnt work

Are you using a custom mapping? Does some functions work but not the Play/Pause button?

This is a typical sign of a double installed mapping. Play is always a toggle, so if its applied twice it cancels itself.

# DJ collection converters

## What is the 26ms shift issue when converting cues/loops between softwares?

* We have found that 6% of the files have a shift of 26 milliseconds when going from Traktor to Rekordbox. The other 94% of the files will be fine.
* This shift is very noticeable and breaks beatgrids/loops. See below for a graphical example of this issue.
* Root issue is different interpretations of the **tricky MP3 LAME tag** (and their derivations  LACV/LAVF). Issues are:
* **Zero LAME CRC ("case c"):**
  * Traktor doesn't accept the LAME tag, but interprets the whole MPEG frame as "music", producing 26ms of garbage; 
  * Rekordbox the same, but skips the whole MPEG frame instead.
* **LAVC/LAVF reduced tags ("case b"):**
  * Traktor produces 26ms of garbage because it doesnt understand this tag; 
  * Rekordbox accepts the tag as a control frame
* Please see [this blog post](#which-dj-converters-avoid-the-26ms-shift-issue) to know who implemented this work

### links
* 26ms research work: https://github.com/digital-dj-tools/dj-data-converter/issues/3

![26ms_problem](pics/26ms_problem.png?raw=true)

## Which DJ converters avoid the 26ms shift issue?

Historically, there was no way to convert your collection on Windows. The only converters available were for MacOS. This has now changed recently.\
All softwares take different approaches to solve the [26ms shift problem](#what-is-the-26ms-shift-issue-when-converting-cuesloops-between-softwares).

This is the current situation as far as I tested it myself:
* **[DJ Data Converter](https://github.com/digital-dj-tools/dj-data-converter)**: This is a command line tool for Windows, WSL, and macOS. This is where the full research of the [26ms shift problem](#what-is-the-26ms-shift-issue-when-converting-cuesloops-between-softwares) was done, and where it was first implemented. This is [another python converter](https://github.com/ErikMinekus/traktor-scripts/blob/master/playlist-export.py).
* **[Rekord Cloud](https://rekord.cloud/wiki/convert-library)**: This is a web application, so it supports all OSes. It also has many other useful features other than DJ conversion. The authors have [read the research](#what-is-the-26ms-shift-issue-when-converting-cuesloops-between-softwares), implemented it for the 26ms case, and then extended it for virtualDJ with a 50ms value. As it is a web app, it created added an offline optional app just to scan shift mp3s.
* **[DJCU](https://www.facebook.com/DJConversionUtility/posts/568896026977298)**: This is a macOS-only application. Recently it got the hability to convert windows files, but still from macOS only. They have a manual tool to correct the shifts after conversion (REKU). More recently they correct shifts automatically using the encoder strings. This is something that I researched before and replaced with LAME/LAVC/LAVF tags instead.
* **[Rekordbuddy](https://next.audio/)**: This is also a macOS-only application. A Windows version is on the works for many years. This app corrects some shift cases correctly automaticlaly, but it misses others as well (when I tested it on a macOS VM).
* **[MIXXX](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2119#issuecomment-533952875)**: A new upcoming feature is reading Rekordbox-prepared USB sticks nativelly. This is of course affected by the 26ms problem. Like rekordcloud, the developers have [read the research](#what-is-the-26ms-shift-issue-when-converting-cuesloops-between-softwares) and implemented it for their case (which depends on the several mp3 libraries they use).
* **[Choones](https://support.choones.app/guides)**: To be tested. Choones is an upcoming web application that does cloud-based conversion among many other features. At time of writing this is not publicly available. I've contated the team by email, and they told me they are aware of the 26ms shift issue.

## How to emulate Elastic Beatgrids in Traktor (2)

This info was moved [here](#How-to-emulate-Elastic-Beatgrids-in-Traktor).


## How to swap Traktor configurations without the slow preferences window

[This script](tools_traktor/traktor_swap_configuration.sh) lets you swap between two traktor configurations easily. 

This is useful when you sometimes use a controller as your audio device, but other times use your internal sound card. 
This saves you to having to open the preferences window to change the audio device, 
which is [very slow when you have large mappings](https://www.native-instruments.com/forum/threads/preferences-window-freeze.328315/page-2#post-1870879).

Script installation:
* save [this script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pestrela/music_scripts/master/traktor/tools_traktor/traktor_swap_configuration.sh) in your desktop with "right-click"/"save-as"
* make the script executable with 'chmod +x traktor_swap_configuration.sh '
* redefine the 'traktor_root_folder' variable to your documents traktor root
* *run it once* to copy the first config

First time setup:
* Open Traktor
* change the config to DDJ-1000
* close traktor
* *run script*
* open traktor
* change config to internal soundcard
* close traktor

To Activate configuration #1:
* *run the script*
* open traktor
* confirm the audio card is ddj-1000
* Close taktor

To Activate configuration #2:
* *run the script*
* open traktor
* confirm the audio card is Internal Soundcard
* Close taktor
 
 
## How I build perfect tracklists using CUE files

I use a set of tools to generate a CUE file with the timings of my sets.
Once I have this file, I can generate tracklists with timestamps like in this example: https://www.mixcloud.com/dj_estrela/mix-17-cd07-trance-jun-2019/

Steps BEFORE the set (for prepared sets):
* group the files in folders, per style (Vocal Trance, Uplifting trance, etc)
* select the tracks and their order using winamp; Once this is OK, run "cue_renumber_files.py" and "cue_make_tracklist.sh".

Steps AFTER the set (both live sets and prepared sets):
* convert the NML to a text tracklist using https://slipmat.io/playlists/
* listen the recording in winamp to spot major mistakes. Tag the locations in MMM:SS format. At the end, use "cue_convert_timestamps.sh" to convert to HH:MM:SS format
* open the huge WAV file in Adobe audition, and perform the following:
  * normalize volume of all tracks
  * fix any obvious mistakes if necessary (eg, track ended too early when playing live, etc)
  * tag the divisions of the tracks inside the wav file
* convert the tags inside the WAV into a CUE file, using this software: http://www.stefanbion.de/cuelisttool/index_e.htm
  * note: this software fails on files bigger than 2Gb (https://forums.adobe.com/thread/309254). Workaround is splittingthe file at the 3hour mark, exactly, then use an option in cue_merge_cues.py to add this offset back in the second file
* convert the tags inside the WAV into a CUE file, using this software: http://www.stefanbion.de/cuelisttool/index_e.htm
* merge the CUE file with the Tracklist file using cue_merge_cues.py
* upload the mix to http://mixcloud.com/dj_estrela
  
  
Overview of the Cue tools:

* cue_renumber_files.py:
  * renumbers mp3 files, in sequence. This is useful to make a sequenced playlist in your operating system folders, outside Traktor.
* cue_make_tracklist.sh:
  * from a folder, generates basic tracklist text files
* cue_convert_timestamps.sh:
  * convert MMM:SS to HH:MM:SS format. Winamp uses the first format, Adobe audition uses the second 
* cue_merge_cues.py: 
  * this is the main tool. It merge back and forth any CUE file with any tracklist text file. 
    It can read either case from separate or single files. It also cleans the artist - title fields, and generates timestamped tracklists 
* cue_rename_cue.sh: 
  *  matches the CUE file contents with the FILE tag. This is useful when you rename the files externally.

## How to optimize a laptop for DJ Software - Summary
  
Every year laptops have more and more Power saving tricks.\
These tricks are *VERY* damaging for DJ software.\

For a demo of theses issues please see at 1:20 of https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=85&v=ijFJZf_KSM8

Below some *quick fixes* to try first you have crackle / glitches / noise:

* a) *Continuous* crackle when playing:
  * Raise the driver buffer
* b) Crackle when when *moving the Jogs*:
  * Disable turbo boost ([steps](#how-to-avoid-crackle--glitches--noise-on-windows-by-disabling-intel-turbo-boost))
* c) *Random* crackle:
  * Disable wireless
  * Update the BIOS and all Drivers from your laptop manufacturer
  * Disable all power saving features (Turbo boost, Speedsteep, USB selective sleep, ...)
  
if not enough, then please read below  
  

## How to optimize a laptop for DJ Software - Complex case
  
If the quick fixes above were not enough then there is **no easy solution**. 

The way forward is complex:
* **Measure:** Measure the problems using [LatencyMon], [DPCLatency], [IDLT] and [SMI_reporter] to establish an objective baseline
* **Performance Guides:** Study performance guides that are specific to audio
* **Update log:** Study update logs to understand what changed when. This list can be quite big. 
* **Disable drivers:** disable the drivers one by one measuring in between 
* **Downgrade drivers:** as above, but downgrading components one by one while re-measuring 
* **Low-level Trace:** Generate a trace of the whole system using Windows Performance tools

Again: measurement is crucial to control every change to the system.
  
## How to avoid crackle / glitches / noise on Windows by disabling Intel turbo boost?

If you have an HP laptop and have crackle when move the jogs you have to disable Intel turbo boost.

There are 3 ways to disable turbo boost:
a) Specific program (best way): Use the "Quick CPU" software: https://www.coderbag.com/product/quickcpu
b) Set windows power to 99% CPU: [guide](https://forums.pioneerdj.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015455971-To-those-who-have-crackling-noise-when-using-DDJ-1000-with-rekordbox-dj)
c) BIOS config: https://support.serato.com/hc/en-us/articles/203057850-PC-Optimization-Guide-for-Windows

Macs have turbo boost, but are not affected. Anyway, the way to disable is [here](https://www.redmondpie.com/how-to-enable-or-disable-turbo-boost-on-mac/)

## Dell laptop pre-installed services latency issues

If you have a Dell laptop, **beware of the services that come preinstalled with the laptop**.

Specifically I've measured that "Dell SupportAssist" causes SECONDS of latency every 30 minutes, due to heavy [SMI interrupts](#How-to-count-SMI-hidden-interrupts-in-Windows)

The solution is simply to disable the Dell services in "services.msc"

**More details:** [smi_counter](https://github.com/pestrela/smi_counter)
 
![dell_support_assist3](https://github.com/pestrela/smi_counter/blob/master/dell_support_assist3.jpg?raw=true)




## How to count SMI (=hidden interrupts) in Windows

If your whole laptop stops once in a while for several seconds - including the mouse - it can be [SMI issues](https://www.resplendence.com/latencymon_cpustalls).

SMIs are "hidden interrupts" that the BIOS can issue at any time and will *lock all cores*.
As these are not visible to the OS, these will confuse latencyMon, but not [IDLT](https://www.resplendence.com/latencymon_idlt).

These interrupts are used, for example, when you change the laptop brightness. 
The CPU has a special counter for these interrupts. 

I've made a small tool to read this special counter in Windows: [count_smi tool](https://github.com/pestrela/smi_counter) 

Below a simple test that shows that changing the brightness in Dell XPS "costs" 4 SMIs:

USB cables may be too thin and not deliver enough power to your controller.\
Confirm your cable does NOT have these labels:

* 28AWGX2C
* AWG 28X2C
 
In general you want the "2C" label to have "24" and not "28".\

Apple and MacOS is in general a better choice to do audio work (both DJing and Production). 

The operating system is stronger because it was built on Unix. The hardware and software are better 
integrated as they are built by the same company. 
And there is generally less bugs across the board as the hardware are standardized (ie, all macs are the same inside the same model).

Nevertheless its definitely not perfect; while I've seen more issues in Windows, I've also seen issues in Macs. 
In particular, as of Nov 2019 this got a lot worse with MacOS Catalina, namely as it migrated to 64-bit only drivers and the removal of itunes/music App. 

So if I say the mac is still overall a better choice for Music, so why I'm using a Dell XPS 15 windows? 
Main reasons are:
* **a) Folder Tree:** I use File explorer with the [full tree visible all the time](#why-i-manage-music-using-os-folders-only). I've tried Finder several times but did not enjoyed their paradigms. 
Also tried to use a windows file explorer clone for mac, it was completely abandoned by the author.
* **b) No flexibility:** AKA the "one apple way". I've never got used to their GUI, their keyboard shortcuts, 
and the keyboard itself. 
In particular there is the extremely annoying decision of having to use 2 hands for the
 [forward delete key](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/why-no-delete-key.1360799/). 
Same story for the Maximize feature. Same story for lack of USB-A ports, SD cards and dongles. 
Ditto for no headphone jack in recent iphones.
In all cases the answer is  "get used to it". Well, I didn't.\
See also [my Windows tweaks](#Generic-Windows-tweaks-and-programs-I-use)
* **c) Software library:** Very limited choice on software and freeware, as compared to Windows
* **d) Expensive:** Underpowered machines, when compared to their direct windows counterparts [in the same price range](https://musiccritic.com/equipment/disk-jockey/best-laptops-for-djing/)
* **e) Command Line:** I use the command heavily to automate tasks in bash, git updates, and python programming.

## WSL Linux shell on Windows

I use the command heavily to automate tasks in bash, git updates, and python programming.

For years I've used a linux VM inside windows, but now I only use WSL.

## Generic Windows tweaks and programs I use 

I love [customization](https://www.neogaf.com/threads/some-of-my-cant-live-without-progams-what-are-yours.1482889/), so I have installed several tweaker apps. These are all GUIS to edit the refgistry and change / unlock / customize windows features. Below the reviews:
* [Activaid](https://www.ghacks.net/2014/09/24/activaid-is-a-useful-autohotkey-script-collection/)
* [Winareo tweraker](https://winaero.com/comment.php?comment.news.1836)
* [Ultimate windows tweaker](https://www.thewindowsclub.com/ultimate-windows-tweaker-4-windows-10)
* [NirSoft utils](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/)
* [Win 10 annoyances](https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/how-to-fix-the-most-annoying-things-in-windows-10)

Plus some specific programs:
* [QQTabbar](https://www.techsupportalert.com/content/qttabbar.htm): Adds tabs to File Explorer, folder bookmarks and program shortcuts. Please see below pictures.
* [Link Clump](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/linkclump/lfpjkncokllnfokkgpkobnkbkmelfefj?hl=en): Make a rectangle around hyperlinks; open all in new tabs.
* [WinDirStat](https://windirstat.net/): find missing disk space hogs
* [Resilio sync](https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/download/backup-recovery/resilio-sync-263-3331463/): automatic folder synchronization
* [Allway Sync](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/file-sync-backup,review-1060-4.html): manual folder synchronization

## How to use QQTabBar with multiple tabs, folder bookmarks and program launchers

QQTabbar ([link to a review](https://www.techsupportalert.com/content/qttabbar.htm)) is 
an amazing file explorer add-on. It supports multiple tabs, folder bookmarks and program launchers.\
I use this every day to open WSL linux terminals in the current folder, and to open audio files programs directly.

Usage:
![qqtabbar_usage](pics/qqtabbar_usage.jpg?raw=true)

Configuring Launchers:
![qqtabbar_launchers](pics/qqtabbar_launchers.jpg?raw=true)

## How to add WSL scripts to QQTabBar

Combining QQTabBar and WSL bash scripts is a powerful way to manipulate files in Explorer.

Example programs from [here](../wsl_tools/):
* windows_launch_spek.sh: calls the spek frequency analyzer for several files
* windows_group_files_in_folder.sh: create a sub-folder and move selected files into it 
* simple WSL shell launch on that folder

Most important tricks are:
* launch bash as 'wsl.exe --cd %cd% -- <your_script> %f%'
  * '--cd %cd% --' changes the working folder to that location
  * without further parameters this opens an interactive shell
* process the files with "wslpath $file" to convert to WSL format
  * if you are launching windows programs, use the arguments "as-is"

* [Issues of the V6 Rekordbox migration - Minor](#issues-of-the-V6-Rekordbox-migration---minor)
* [What is NOT unlocked in the Rekordbox V6 hardware options](#What-is-NOT-unlocked-in-the-Rekordbox-V6-hardware-options)

## Issues of the V6 Rekordbox migration - Major

1) **Vendor Lock-in:**
* V6 encrypts the database and removed the XML export option.
  * Discussion: https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/g11s3l
  * Workaround: https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/g2c9l9
* This vendor lock-in doesn't look good on latest European regulations:
  * "To eliminate vendor lock-in practices, the Regulation provides for and encourages 
  the development of codes of conduct for service providers. With these codes of conduct, 
  consumers should be able to switch to other service providers more easily."
  * source: https://www.gtlaw-amsterdamlawblog.com/2018/11/another-privacy-regulation-but-this-time-on-non-personal-data/

2) **Perpetual bought licenses** do not transfer to subscription model:
* I've bought a rekordbox performance (149 USD), rekordbox video (99USD)and RMX pack (9.9USD) to use in my SX2. Total cost: 260USD w/o Tax.
  * V5 licenses: https://web.archive.org/web/20200217154645/https://rekordbox.com/en/plan/pluspacks/
* This V5 license doesn't carry over to the new subscription model
  * Note: This is orthogonal to the hardware unlock option (see https://rekordbox.com/en/support/link )
  
The XML vendor lock is a **deal breaker** for me.\
The dead V5 license is just annoying (there will be no V5 improvements and I don't expect any support moving forward).
  

## Issues of the V6 Rekordbox migration - Minor
  
Besides the XML export and the bought licenses problem there is additional smaller issues:\
no search box on the explorer node; no midi mapping with modifiers, multiple actions and CFX selector;\
Cannot physically delete files inside RB. Still hotcues do not move the floating cue.

On the plus side, it now automatically auto-relocate renamed and moved tracks.\
It also has shared audio and video playlists.\
And a Day skin ([guide](#How-to-enable-day-skin-in-any-software) )

The other functions I either do not use (streaming, ableton link) or have my own solution (cloud).

  

  
## What is NOT unlocked in the Rekordbox V6 hardware options

With V6 there are combinations of equipemnt that unlock *some* functionality.
* Plans: https://rekordbox.com/en/plan/
* Hardware: https://rekordbox.com/en/support/link

Combining both lists, this is what is NOT unlocked:
* Cloud Sync
* Video (except RXZ)
* Lyrics
* DVS (except DJM-750Mk2, 450, 250MK2, interface2, DDJ-RZ, XP1, XP2)
* Sampler sequence saving
* RMX effects

All these need either the 10eur/mo or the 15eur/mo subscription (August 2020 new prices)

For example, this is how video looks like with my DDJ-1000 connected:

## How to enable day skin in any software

If you are playing on the bright outside you will not see a thing.
Some softwares provide a specific skin for this situation.

But this feature is native to the OS: 

Windows 10:
* Press Win + Plus / settings / Invert Colors / Turn on magnifier
* [guide](https://windowsreport.com/inverted-colors-windows-10/)

MacOS:
* “System Preferences” > “Keyboard” > “Shortcuts” > “Accessibility” >  “Invert Colors
* [guide](https://devicebar.com/invert-display-colors-on-apple-mac-os-x/2642/)

  
  
## How I recorded my old radio show recordings and found the IDs

I had old K7s mixtapes from around 1996 from local radio shows that I really liked. 
These shows have significantly shaped my electronic music tastes. 
Recently I've took the time to preserve these relics, and find the IDs for the tracks that I've been looking for 22 years. 

The steps were:
* I've first recorded all my 15 cassettes in a single go. 
* Then added the cues in adobe audition. 
* Then split it by mix sessions. Sometimes it were just isolated tracks, sometimes it was a sequence of 10 tracks. 
* Then I've combined these into packs of 2 hours each. The first pack is now online: https://www.mixcloud.com/Dj_Estrela_House/radio-cidade-superpista-1997-recordings/ 
* Them made the known tracklist and exact timestamps using a CUE file

Regrading the IDs:
* I've first extracted JUST the IDs into yet another pack. 
* This was uploaded to mixcloud:   https://www.mixcloud.com/Dj_Estrela_House/superpista-ids-1997-recordings-full-versions/
* Benefits:
  * its much easier to show to knowledgeable DJs in a single go
  * mixcloud is able to identify some tracks for you

## How I edited my videos showing the Traktor screen 

On my latest demo videos I show both the controller and the traktor screen simultaneously. It looks pretty cool.
To get the basic idea, see this DJ tech tools article: https://djtechtools.com/2012/06/24/how-to-make-a-great-dj-video/

Concrete steps:

* Equipment
  * Smartphone
  * As much illumination as possible
  * Buy a microphone stand with a strong hold: [example](https://www.amazon.com/Adjustable-Microphone-Suspension-Broadcasting-Voice-Over/dp/B00DY1F2CS/)
  * Buy a smartphone flexible tripod:  [example](https://www.amazon.com/Universal-Octopus-Adjustable-Cellphone-Smartphone/dp/B06XRFC75Y/)

* Recording  
  * Put the smartphone as high as possible, and with the most illumination possible. 
  Ideally, grab the microphone stand on **ANOTHER** desk, so that your scratching will not vibrate the smartphone.
  * Record the controller image in 16:9 format
  * Record the laptop screen using [this free tool](https://www.freescreenrecording.com/)
  * If its a spoken video, record the audio from the smartphone. If its pure DJing use from the mixer output, or internal Traktor.

* Editing part 1: merge everything to a single video
  * Download [openshot](https://www.openshot.org). Read this [tutorial for basics](https://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/an-introduction-to-video-editing-in-openshot-2-0/). [this is another tutorial](https://gist.github.com/peanutbutterandcrackers/f0f666243133e0ed25abbc12a4ba23d7)
  * Change profile to a 4:3 format, 30fps (preferences / profile). This is crucial to fit both the controller and the top traktor screen
  * Add the Controller video on Track 1. Click in the very first frame. Use effects / crop to crop the controller to size. Use right click / transform to center and scale it to the bottom of the screen
  * Move the video to the middle of the timeline. Lock track 1 so that it no longer moves
  * Add the Screen video to Track 2. Do the same steps as before to crop and scale / center the video on the top part of the screen
  * Sync the two videos by finding something unique (eg press play). Zoom in a lot. Disable snap for precise alignment. Confirm alignment in the end of the video
  * Render the video to a 4:3 format (1024x728, 30fps, MP4). Create a profile in your documents / .openshot / profiles folder, based on 
  

* Editing part 2: cuts, effects, transitions, etc
  * get windows essentials 2012 [archive link](https://www.tenforums.com/software-apps/104887-can-i-get-movie-maker-win10-again.html#post1304260); install only windows movie maker 2012.
  * To create separators: home / add / title; Then animations / wipe right / normal
  * To create captions: home / add / caption; then set legtth
  * to add arrows: add a caption with windings 3 font
  * change project to 4:3 format 
  * ...
 
 
## How I synchronize and backup my whole Traktor music and configuration across laptops and a NAS

I have **all** my Traktor files synchronized between laptops. This includes [100Gb of music](#why-i-manage-music-using-os-folders-only)
 and all Traktor files.
 
I can use any laptop at any time, one at the time, and my whole collection is there fully analyzed. As my NAS is just another client, I get automatic RAID-0 backups as well.\
In a nutshell this is like having everything inside your own private google drive, without size limits.

My folder structure is:
* C:\Main - Contains all my private files
  * \Traktor - Whole folder synchronized by resilio sync
    * \Samples  - All samples go here
    * \Remix_sets - all remix sets go here
    * \Root_dir  - All settings, stripes, etc go here
      * \Logs
      * \Stripes
      * etc
    * \Music  - all my music goes here. Organization is [by genres](#why-i-manage-music-using-os-folders-only)
      * \Genre_1
      * \Genre_2
      * etc
      
Steps were:
* Install [resilio sync](https://www.resilio.com/individuals/)
* Point your traktor root folder to "C:\Main\Traktor\Root_dir" (Settings / File / Directories / Root_dir)
* Restart traktor
* Do the same for samples and remix sets  (Settings / File / Directories / Samples | Remixe_sets)
* Move your files to "C:\Main\Traktor\Music"
* Share the whole "C:\Main\Traktor" folder in resilio sync

**Warning:** do a manual backup first before changing your traktor files and music collection!

## How to fix DDJ-1000 loose jogs

(taken form FB post, to clean up and add pictures)

LOOSE JOG WHEEL DISCOVERY 
READ BELOW....

It seems the part that is responsible for keeping the jog wheel in place is not the rollers at all. 

It’s a bracket that has two stationary barrels attached to it. The one in the back is for right to left movement and the one in the front is for front to back movement. 

If you have a jog wheel that is loose this is the part that has failed or has come defective from manufacturing. 

These barrels sit inside of a channel on the under side of the jog wheel top plate ( where your hand makes contact to scratch )

The way the barrels are held onto the bracket is they are pressed into the bracket and center-punched to mushroom the metal to lock it in place on the bottom. 

* When a jog wheel develops front to back movement the front barrel will be found to be loose and exhibit a wobble on the bracket. 

* When a jog wheel develops side to side movement the rear barrel will be found to be loose and exhibit a wobble on the bracket. 

If you are able to carefully center punch the shaft from the bottom of the bracket it is possible to re-secure the barrel.
Once the barrel is secured properly to the bracket your movement in your jog wheel will be eliminated. 

I’m trying to get a part number(s) in case anyone is tired of sending in their unit and it coming back not fixed. 

Honestly this is something that pioneer should have done a recall on as I’ve seen so many posts about it here and on forums and have spoke to SAM ASH and Guitar Center with both retailers aware and complaining about the issue. 

Pioneers stance is to keep quiet when all they had to do is replace this bracket that probably cost them 5.00 to have made. 

The labor for the repair is most likely why they are keeping quiet. It’s just unacceptable.

  
## How to replace the DDJ-1000 filter knobs with Silver knobs

Both 1000 and 1000SRT have extremely [dull filter knobs](../pics/silver_knobs/DDJ-1000RB.jpg). Which is a pity.\
For now the best fit is [DAA1309](https://www.pacparts.com/part.cfm?part_no=DAA1309&mfg=Pioneer) from the DDJ-SZ or DJM-900. This is an almost perfect fit.

Folder with pictures of the knobs: [here](../pics/silver_knobs)

* [DAA1309](../pics/silver_knobs/DAA1309.png):

## Some people from which I've learned a lot from the Global DJ community

"AKA my DJ hall of fame".
![Hall Of Fame](pics/hall_of_fame.jpg)

When I started DJing in 2000 I've learned a lot from local DJs in Lisbon that I've meet regularly.\
The ones I worked the most were Rui Remix, Bruno Espadinha, Joao Vaz, Jaylion, Miguel Assumpcao and DJ Ice.

20 years later the Internet changed this locality a lot.\
You can now learn anything from youtube tutorials, reading articles and have insightful conversations with people that you may never meet.

Below some of the people that I've learned the most. Apologies if I forget anyone.\
All of them made significant contributions either in articles, software or video tutorials. 
In the vast majority this is applicable to any DJ software.

Most of them I've either meet them in person and/or had numerous conversations over chat.
