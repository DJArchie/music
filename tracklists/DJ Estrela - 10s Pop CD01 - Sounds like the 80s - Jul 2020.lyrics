	Many faces I have known, many ways in which I've grown
	Moving closer on my own

	Wondering if I'll stay
	Young and restless
	Living this way I stress less

	The pain sets in and I don't cry
	I only feel gravity and I wonder why

	I can't help myself
	I can't break the spell
	I can't even try
	.
	I'm in over my head
	You got under skin
	I got no strength at all
	In the state that I'm in

	And my knees are weak
	And my mouth can't speak
	Fell too far this time

	Chorus:
	Baby, I'm too lost in you
	Caught in you
	Lost in everything about you
	So deep, I can't sleep
	I can't think

	And you're all I see
	And you're all I need
	Help me baby (help me baby)
	Help me baby (help me now)
	.
	Cos I'm slipping away
	Like the sand to the tide
	Falling into your arms
	Falling into your eyes

	You only see what your eyes want to see
	How can life be what you want it to be
	You're frozen when your heart's not open
	.
	You're so consumed with how much you get
	You waste your time with hate and regret
	You're broken when your heart's not open
	.
	Mmm, mmm, if I could melt your heart
	Mmm, mmm, we'd never be apart
	Mmm, mmm, give yourself to me
	Mmm, mmm, you hold the key
	.
	Now there's no point in placing the blame
	And you should know I suffer the same
	If I lose you my heart will be broken
	.
	Love is a bird, she needs to fly
	Let all the hurt inside of you die
	You're frozen when your heart's not open
	.
	Mmm, mmm, if I could melt your heart
	Mmm, mmm, we'd never be apart
	Mmm, mmm, give yourself to me

	I don't like walking around this old and empty house
	So hold my hand, I'll walk with you, my dear
	The stairs creak as you sleep, it's keeping me awake
	It's the house telling you to close your eyes
	.
	And some days I can't even dress myself
	It's killing me to see you this way

	Well, tell her that I miss our little talks
	Soon it will be over, and buried with our past
	We used to play outside when we were young and full of life and full of love
	Some days I don't know if I am wrong or right
	Your mind is playing tricks on you, my dear
	'Cause though the truth may vary this
	Ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

	My love is on the line
	(Dil Laa liya be-parwa de naal)
	My love is on the line
	.
	[Verse 1]
	A little late for all the things you didn't say
	I'm not sad for you
	But I'm sad for all the time I had to waste
	'Cause I learned the truth
	Your heart is in a place I no longer wanna be
	I knew there'd come a day I'd set you free
	Cause I'm sick and tired of always being sick and tired
	.
	(Dil Laa liya be-parwa de naal)
	(Dil Laa liya be-parwa de naal)

	Your love isn't fair
	You live in a world where you didn't listen
	And you didn't care
	So I'm floating, I'm floating on air

	(Dil Laa liya be-parwa de naal)
	(Dil Laa liya be-parwa de naal)
	.
	[Verse 2]
	No warning of such a sad song
	Of broken hearts
	My dreams of fairytales and fantasies, oh
	Were torn apart, oho
	I lost my peace of mind somewhere along the way
	I knew there come a time you'd hear me say
	I'm sick and tired of always being sick and tired
	.
	(Dil Laa liya be-parwa de naal)

	.

	I'm losing my self control
	Yeah, you're starting to trickle back in
	But I don't wanna fall down the rabbit hole
	Cross my heart, I won't do it again
	.
	I tell myself, tell myself, tell myself, "Draw the line"
	And I do, I do
	But once in a while I trip up, and I cross the line
	And I think of you
	.
	Two years, and just like that, my head still takes me back
	Thought it was done, but I guess it's never really over
	Oh, we were such a mess, but wasn't it the best?
	Thought it was done, but I guess it's never really over
	.
	Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
	And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
	And I'll have to get over you all over again
	.
	Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
	And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
	And I'll have to get over you all over again
	.
	I guess I could try hypnotherapy
	I gotta rewire this brain
	'Cause I can't even go on the internet
	Without even checking your name
	.

	Was the last, but I guess it's never really over

	[Verse 1]
	Same time each night you're over
	I smell that whisky on ya
	I'm caught up, so caught up
	I'm so conflicted over
	Whether to take you back when
	You disrespectin' on me

	[Pre-Chorus]
	Dancin' in a bar on a summer's night
	You turned to me and then you held me tight
	Whispered in my ear that the feeling's right
	But that was another life
	Then you kissed my friend at the 80s party
	I was on a plane when I saw your story
	Now you're comin' here sayin' "I'm so sorry"
	But we'rе over

	Tell myself I'm better, it's not true
	I'm caught up, so caught up
	Still caught up thinkin' 'bout you
	Do you still drink whisky to numb your brain?
	Do you picture my face when I was on the plane?
	When you're with her, and the song plays
	Can you help thinkin' back to
	.

	When I heard that sound
	When the walls came down
	I was thinking about you
	About you
	When my skin grows old
	When my breath runs cold
	I'll be thinking about you
	About you
	.
	Seconds from my heart
	A bullet from the dark
	Helpless, I surrender
	Shackled by your love
	Holding me like this
	With poison on your lips
	Only when it's over
	The silence hits so hard
	.
	'Cause it was almost love, it was almost love
	It was almost love, it was almost love
	.
	When I heard that sound
	When the walls came down
	I was thinking about you
	About you
	When my skin grows old
	When my breath runs cold
	I'll be thinking about you
	About you
	.
	When I run out of air to breathe
	It's your ghost I see
	I'll be thinking about you, about you
	It was almost love, it was almost...
	.
	We bleed ourselves in vain
	How tragic is this game?
	Turn around, I'm holding on to someone
	But the love is gone
	Carrying the load, with wings that feel like stone
	Knowing that we nearly fell so far now
	It's hard to tell
	.
	Yeah we came so close, it was almost love
	It was almost love, it was almost love
	.
	When I heard that sound
	When the walls came down
	I was thinking about you
	About you
	When my skin grows old
	When my breath runs cold
	I'll be thinking about you
	About you
	.
	When I run out of air to breathe
	It's your ghost I see
	I'll be thinking about you, about you
	.
	While I reached out for your hand
	When the walls were caving in
	When I see you on the other side
	We can try all over again
	.
	When I heard that sound
	When the walls came down
	I was thinking about you
