Exclusive Mix:
--------------

DJ Estrela presents a 2h mix that covers all of its best loved styles. 
It starts with vocal trance, similar to its own series called “mix 11”, available on djestrela.com. Then, starting from track 8, the set smoothly increases BPMs, and moves into a variety of styles, covering some progressive (“mix 13” series) and tech trance sounds (“mix 15” series). The final smooth BPM increase happens from track 14 till the end, by reaching energetic uplifting trance (representing its “mix 12” series).
